-> Mechanics of 2D bodies
   -> mass of a body
   -> position of a body
   -> velocity of a body
   -> acceleration of a body
   -> force on a body
   -> static friction
   -> sliding friction
   -> uniform gravitational field
(implement position, velocity, acceleration and force and frictional force as a vector not as a scalar)

-> Rotational mechanics of a 2D body
   -> moment of inertia of a body about a specified axis
   -> angle of rotation of a body about a specified axis
   -> angular velocity of a body about a specified axis
   -> angular acceleration of a body about a specified axis
   -> torque on a body about a specified axis
   -> rolling friction

-> Collisions
   -> collisions inbetween any n-sided polygon, n < 11
   -> collisions between a circle and any n-sided polygon

-> Gravity between any 2 objects
   -> gravitational force between 2 bodies using newton's law of gravity (F = GMm/d^2)

-> Air resistance and drag acting on a rigid body

-> Spring mechanics

-> Ideal and non-ideal ropes, and tension
   -> tension on a rope

-> simulating fluids (if possible)

-> GUI for the user to change the values of the physical quantities and constants
